# ANNDP Challenges 2021/2022

In this repository you can find the solutions we propose for the challenges of the Politecnico di Milano course 'Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning' (a.a.: 2021/2022). 
In each folder you can find a brief explanation of the challenge and our solution, commented in the pdf files that can be found in the folders themselves

### Homework_2: Time Series Forecasting

In this homework, you are required to predict future samples of a multivariate time series. The goal is to design and implement forecasting models to learn how to exploit past observations in the input sequence to correctly predict the future.
